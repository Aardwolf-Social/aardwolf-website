### State of the Aardwolf
Cutting to the chase.  Here is the current status of the project.

<strong>General Status</strong>
- The `main` branch compiles with Rust `stable`
- Templates do not work (due to i18n crate issues)
- Switched to Yew Framework for frontend

<hr />

### Prioritization
Here are the current priorities for the project

<strong>Backend Priorities</strong>
- API ALL THE THINGS!

<strong>Front-End Priorities</strong>
- Waiting on backend API's before continuing with Yew templates
- Rip, and Replace old i18n crate with `rust_i18n` which seems to be maintained.

Cheers!

- Banjo
